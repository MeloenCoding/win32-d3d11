# win32-d3d11
A boilerplate project for the win32 crate. Fully documented with good references and usefull links.

## Usefull documentation i've used
- See for the win32 side of this project with explanations and usefull links: https://github.com/MeloenCoding/win32-example

## Why

I'm uploading this because there are way to few projects that use and explain this api. Msdn sucks (sorry microsoft but it's a mess), no 
videos about it whatsoever along with the examples from the creators themselves are garbage and don't explain anything. Therefore i am 
uploading this project. Every time i learn new things about this crate i'll upload it and try to explain what i learned and what i think 
it does. 

If i am incorrect about something, please tell me.
