D3D11: ERROR: ID3D11DeviceContext::OMSetRenderTargets: The RenderTargetView at slot 0 is not compatable with the 
DepthStencilView. DepthStencilViews may only be used with RenderTargetViews if the effective dimensions of the 
Views are equal, as well as the Resource types, multisample count, and multisample quality. The RenderTargetView 
at slot 0 has (w:400,h:300,as:1), while the Resource is a Texture2D with (mc:1,mq:0). The DepthStencilView has 
(w:1280,h:720,as:1), while the Resource is a Texture2D with (mc:1,mq:0). D3D11_RESOURCE_MISC_TEXTURECUBE factors
 into the Resource type, unless GetFeatureLevel() returns D3D_FEATURE_LEVEL_10_1 or greater. [ STATE_SETTING ERROR
